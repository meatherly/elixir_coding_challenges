# Welcome to Elixir Coding Challenges!

This repo serves as a place where you can explore how to do new things in Elixir or compare Elixir to other languages doing the same thing.

These challenges will try to push you outside the norms of `Hello World` by dealing with topics like: distributed Elixir, parsing Binary, dealing with network protocols, and good ole data processing.

## How to use this repo

At the root of this repo you'll see the `challenges` folder. Inside of that will be a list of markdown files with the challenges. Those markdown files will list out what you're trying to build. This allows you to run `mix new` in the root of the project to create child folders to work on your challenge.
